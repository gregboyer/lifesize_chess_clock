Purpose:

Giant chess board games need giant chess clocks. Imagine playing on those very large (10ftx10ft) outdoor boards, but with added cardio, especially as time runs own. 

Usage:
- Hold button 4s to "power on" or "power off" clocks
- Adjust clocks manually
- Hit the button a single time when you've moved
